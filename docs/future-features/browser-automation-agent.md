# Browser Automation Agent for 10 Ocean

## Overview

Integrate StageHand/Browserbase into the main application to enable automated browser interactions on behalf of tenants. This would transform 10 Ocean from a reactive platform to a proactive tenant advocate.

## Core Concept

Allow users or AI agents to navigate external websites (landlord portals, city databases, etc.) to automatically collect evidence, track payments, and monitor tenant rights.

## Potential Use Cases

### 1. Landlord Portal Integration
- **Purpose**: Automatically access landlord payment portals
- **Features**:
  - Extract payment history and rent receipts
  - Check maintenance request statuses
  - Screenshot important notices or policy changes
  - Monitor for new communications

### 2. Evidence Collection Assistant
- **Purpose**: Gather official documentation from government sites
- **Features**:
  - Navigate to city housing department websites
  - Capture building violation records
  - Screenshot code enforcement notices
  - Extract inspection reports
  - Download public records

### 3. Automated Rent Tracking
- **Purpose**: Build comprehensive payment histories
- **Features**:
  - Log into payment portals monthly
  - Extract rent payment confirmations
  - Alert tenants about missing receipts
  - Build payment history timelines
  - Flag discrepancies

### 4. Smart Communication Logging
- **Purpose**: Automatically document landlord communications
- **Features**:
  - When users paste a landlord portal URL
  - Agent navigates and extracts relevant communications
  - Auto-categorizes and files the information
  - Creates screenshots for evidence
  - Links to existing issues

### 5. Rights Research Agent
- **Purpose**: Keep tenants informed of their rights
- **Features**:
  - Navigate to local housing authority sites
  - Extract current tenant rights information
  - Find relevant legal precedents
  - Keep rights database updated
  - Alert tenants to policy changes

## Technical Architecture

### Security Considerations
- Encrypted credential storage (use Clerk or similar)
- Secure browser isolation (Browserbase)
- Audit logging for all automated actions
- User consent and control mechanisms

### Permission Model
- Add new permission: `BROWSER_AUTOMATION`
- Tenant opt-in required
- Admin oversight capabilities
- Activity monitoring dashboard

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Browserbase API integration
- Scheduled job system (cron)
- File storage for screenshots/documents
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data

### Example API Design

```typescript
// POST /api/agent/portal-sync
{
  "portalUrl": "https://landlordportal.com",
  "portalType": "PAYMENT_PORTAL",
  "credentials": {
    "username": "encrypted_username",
    "password": "encrypted_password"
  },
  "syncType": "PAYMENT_HISTORY"
}

// Response
{
  "success": true,
  "extractedData": {
    "payments": [...],
    "screenshots": ["url1", "url2"],
    "lastSyncDate": "2025-01-23"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Set up Browserbase integration
- Create secure credential storage
- Build basic navigation agent
- Implement screenshot capture

### Phase 2: Portal Integration
- Add common landlord portal templates
- Create extraction schemas for each portal type
- Build error handling and retry logic
- Implement data normalization

### Phase 3: Automation
- Add scheduled sync capabilities
- Create notification system for findings
- Build comparison/diff detection
- Implement auto-categorization

### Phase 4: Intelligence
- Train models on portal layouts
- Add anomaly detection
- Create predictive alerts
- Build recommendation engine

## User Experience

### Setup Flow
1. User adds portal credentials (encrypted)
2. System verifies access
3. User selects sync frequency
4. Initial data extraction
5. Ongoing monitoring begins

### Dashboard Features
- Portal connection status
- Recent extractions
- Detected changes/alerts
- Screenshot gallery
- Export capabilities

## Success Metrics
- Time saved per tenant
- Evidence collection rate
- Issue resolution speed
- Portal coverage percentage
- User satisfaction scores

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Portal changes**: Use AI to adapt to layout changes
- **Rate limiting**: Implement smart scheduling
- **Legal concerns**: Clear user consent and data ownership
- **Technical failures**: Robust error handling and notifications

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-tenant portal coordination
- Legal document analysis
- Automated form filling
- Cross-portal data correlation
- Predictive maintenance alerts
